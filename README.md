## 🔬 Research Focus

I work at the intersection of **cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and AI safety**, with an emphasis on building systems that can **reason, explain, and align with human values**.

- 🧠 **Cognitive Intelligence Systems** (ACT-R / SOAR-inspired reasoning)
- 🧩 **AI Safety & Interpretability** (chain-of-thought monitoring, alignment)
- ⚙️ **High-Performance AI Systems** (CUDA, scalable learning & simulation)
- 🤝 **Human–AI Reasoning Transparency**

## 🚧 Current Work

### 🧩 Cognitive Assistant for Student Mental Health *(Research Prototype)*
A non-clinical cognitive AI system designed to:
- Infer **intent, emotion, and cognitive load**
- Reason using **cognitive architectures**
- Provide **transparent recommendations** (music, reading, reflection)

🔗 Repository: *work in progress*  
📄 Research notes: *in preparation*

### 🔍 Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Framework (CoT-MF)
A technical AI safety framework to:
- Inspect internal reasoning traces of LLMs
- Detect hallucinations and unsafe reasoning paths
- Improve interpretability and auditability

🔗 Repository: *in preparation*
